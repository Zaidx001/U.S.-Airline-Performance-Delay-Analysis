# ✈️ U.S. Airline Performance & Delay Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes U.S. domestic airline performance and flight delays to uncover insights into factors influencing delays, cancellations, and overall service quality.  
The dataset provides detailed flight information including departure/arrival times, delay reasons, airline carriers, and airports across the United States.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze flight performance trends across different airlines and airports  
- Identify major causes of flight delays and cancellations  
- Compare airline reliability based on delay percentages  
- Visualize patterns such as seasonal trends, busiest routes, and delay distributions  
- Provide actionable insights for airlines and passengers

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights  
- **Delay Trends** – Distribution of delays by airline, airport, and time of year  
- **Performance Metrics** – On-time performance comparison among major carriers  
- **Cancellations & Diversions** – Reasons and frequency across different routes  
- **Seasonality** – Impact of weather and peak travel periods on delays  
- **Top Airports** – Analysis of the most delayed airports vs. the most reliable ones
